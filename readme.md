# README

This project aims to provide insights into Facebook pages of [Hillary Clinton](https://www.facebook.com/hillaryclinton/?fref=ts) and [Donald Trump](https://www.facebook.com/DonaldTrump/?fref=ts). Their respective Facebook accounts do not account for all their social media interactions, however they do provide a reasonable sample and since Facebook offers a convenient API that allows to extract their data, it was used for the purpose of this project.

The Tableau dashboard based on this project is available [here](https://public.tableau.com/profile/ivan.rivera#!/vizhome/US_Elections/FBDashboard).
